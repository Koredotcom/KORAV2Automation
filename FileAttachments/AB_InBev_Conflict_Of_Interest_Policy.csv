1.  INTRODUCTION,"1.1 As colleagues at AB InBev, we are owners who make decisions strictly in AB InBev's interests,  without  regard  to  personal  gain.  That  is  why  AB  InBev  colleagues  are required to disclose all ethical, legal, financial, or other interests that may conflict with AB InBev's interests or give the appearance of conflicting with AB InBev's interests. 1.2 Disclosure  allows  AB  InBev  to  mitigate  or  resolve  a  conflict  or  potential  conflict  of interest.  Failing  to  promptly  disclose  a  conflict,  a  potential  conflict  or  an  apparent conflict of interest is always a violation of this Policy. "
2.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST,"What is a Conflict of Interest 2.1 A conflict of interest can arise when any decision could be influenced, or might appear as being influenced, by the possibility of personal benefit. Actions or relationships that create conflicts of interest are prohibited, unless approved by the Company. 2.2 Conflicts of interest may originate directly from the colleague him/herself, or indirectly, through  his/her  spouse,  partner,  relative  or  person  with  whom  he/she  has  a  close personal relationship. 2.3 Even if not intentional, the mere appearance of a conflict may be just as damaging to AB InBev's, and your own, reputation. 2.4 When  considering  a  course  of  action,  ask  yourself  whether  the  action  you  are considering could create an incentive for you, or appear to others to create an incentive for  you,  to  benefit  yourself,  your  friends  or family,  or  an  associated  business at  the expense of AB InBev. If the answer is 'yes,' the action is likely to create a conflict of interest. 2.5 The following examples can be conflicts of interest and require reporting:  "
2.5.1  Personal  Relationships  -  ,a  colleague  in  a  role  that  enable  them  to  influence decisions regarding the employment conditions or performance assessments of a partner or relative employed by AB InBev.
"2.5.2  Personal Investments, Financial Interests in, and Social Relationships with Business Partners"," - a colleague or colleague's relative having a vested interest in  a  competitor,  or  an  AB  InBev  customer,  supplier,  service  provider  or  other counterparty. "
2.5.3  Business Opportunities Found Through Work -," a colleague taking personal advantage of a business opportunity belonging to AB InBev.  2.6 These examples are not exhaustive and are merely some common examples of where conflicts of interest might arise or be perceived to arise. Each of these will be explained in more detail below.     What to do in Case of a Conflict of Interest 2.7 Having a conflict of interest is not necessarily wrong, but failing to promptly disclose is a violation of this Policy. 2.8 If you become aware of an actual or potential conflict (involving you or others), you are required  to  report  it.  The  rule  for  any  situation  that  appears  to  present  a  conflict  of interest is to 'wait and disclose.'  The earlier you report, the easier it will be for our Company to manage the conflict of interest. 2.9 Except  as  otherwise  provided  below,  conflicts  of  interest  or  potential  conflicts  of interest  should  be  reported  both  to  your  Line  Manager  and  to  the  Ethics  & Compliance Team through the Compliance Channel. The Compliance Channel is a website and App that includes a portal for disclosing conflicts of interest. Access can be found here: http://compliancechannelglobal.ab-inbev.com. 2.10 If  you  are  unsure  of  whether  a  particular  situation  creates  an  actual  or  perceived conflict of interest, you must seek guidance from your Line Manager or the Ethics & Compliance Team. 2.11 Each colleague has the responsibility for declaring a conflict or potential conflict of interest, and this responsibility may not be delegated or ignored. When a conflict or potential conflict involves more than one AB InBev colleague, each one must report the situation independently, and cannot rely on the other to report. 2.12 Failing to promptly disclose conflicts or potential conflicts of interest are a violation of this Policy, and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Managing the Potential Conflict 2.13 Once  a  conflict  or  potential  conflict  is  identified,  a  management  plan  may  be developed to appropriately manage or resolve the conflict. Potential outcomes may include: 2.13.1 The colleague receiving permission to proceed or continue with the activity subject to certain conditions or restrictions on access to information or accounts. 2.13.2 For existing business activities, the colleague being required to alter or cease their involvement with the activity. Colleagues will usually be provided with a transition period to divest (even if at a loss), cease or change their involvement. 2.13.3 The colleague being required to: 2.13.3.1 Abstain from voting on, making or influencing decisions or proposals that would potentially implicate the conflict; 2.13.3.2 Withdraw from discussion of affected proposals; 2.13.3.3 Have access to information restricted; and 2.13.3.4 Have  access  denied  to  sensitive  documents  or  confidential information. 2.13.4 Other  reasonable  action  necessary  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  actual  or perceived conflict. Implementation Training and Awareness 2.14 Every AB InBev colleague is responsible for being familiar with the Policy. Ethics & Compliance Committees at the Global and Zone levels will take steps to ensure the Policy  is  communicated  effectively  and  an  appropriate  training  program  is  put  in place. All colleagues will be invited to participate in periodically held training sessions and should familiarize themselves with this Policy. Managers will also receive training on their specific responsibility to evaluate and effectively address conflicts of interest.   Reporting Potential Misconduct/Non-Retaliation 2.15 Any colleague who learns of a potential violation of applicable laws or this Policy can report  his  or  her  suspicion  promptly  through  the  Compliance  Channel.  Colleagues who,  in  good  faith,  report  potential  misconduct  or  who  provide  information  or otherwise  assist  in  any  inquiry  or  investigation  of  potential  misconduct  will  be protected against retaliation. We also are aware that colleagues may want to report concerns  anonymously.  We  have  a  Compliance  Helpline  for  that:  access http://talkopenly.ab-inbev.com or call 1-888-601-6762. 2.16 Our  Compliance  Helpline  is  available  24  hours,  managed  independently,  and anonymous (at your option). The phone line is staffed with people that spoke most of the languages that we have at AB InBev. "
2.5.4  Inventions  -    , a  colleague  using AB  InBev  resources  to  develop his  or  her own invention or working on his or her own personal projects during AB InBev working hours.
2.5.5  Gifts & Entertainment - ,a colleague accepting lavish gifts from a vendor.
2.5.6  Outside  Employment  - ," a  colleague  working  for  another  company,  including his/her own company, during her employment at AB InBev."
2.5.7  Advisory Roles and Board Seats - ,"a colleague taking on a board position with a  competitor  or  an  AB  InBev  customer,  supplier,  service  provider  or  other counterparty."
3.  CONFIDENTIALITY,"3.1  AB InBev will keep the details of all conflicts of interest and complaints confidential to the extent reasonably practicable while still fulfilling its obligation to investigate and manage conflicts of interest.  In each case, we will do our best to respect the privacy of all persons involved. It may be necessary to discuss the facts and circumstances of the conflict with person(s) with knowledge or who are otherwise involved with the conflict  and/or  with  the  colleague's  supervisor(s).  Persons  interviewed  may  be directed not to discuss any aspect of the issue with others and failure to comply with a confidentiality directive may result in disciplinary action. "
4.  PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,"4.1  'Personal relationships' are relationships that extend beyond professional relations and include familial, consensual romantic and/or sexual relationships (whether casual or serious, short or long term) and members of the same household. 4.2  AB  InBev  understands  that  relationships  may  not  always  be  clear-cut,  and  thus,  if colleagues have any questions, they should seek guidance from the People Team or the Ethics & Compliance Team through the Compliance Channel Managers/Supervisors and Reports 4.3  The existence of any personal relationships between a manager or other supervisory colleagues  and  his  or  her  direct  or  indirect  report  must  be  disclosed,  both  to  the supervisory colleague's Line Manager and to either the People Team or the Ethics & Compliance  Team  (or  both).  In  making  the  disclosure,  colleagues  do  not  need  to specify  the  detailed  nature  of  such  personal  relationships  unless  otherwise requested.   Given  the  fundamentally  unbalanced  nature  of  these  types  of relationships, where one party can influence the employment of the other party, these relationships will always be treated as a conflict of interest and AB InBev will take any action reasonably necessary to resolve that conflict of interest. 4.4  While both colleagues have a responsibility to disclose the relationships listed above, a manager's failure to properly disclose may result in more serious discipline. Other Personal Relationships 4.5  The following types of personal relationships have the potential to create conflicts of interest and the existence of such personal relationships must be disclosed both to the  colleague's  Line  Manager  and  to  either  the  People  Team  or  the  Ethics  & Compliance Team through the Compliance Channel (or both); 4.5.1  A member of your family works for AB InBev; 4.5.2  You  have  (or  formerly  had)  a  personal  relationship  with  another  AB  InBev colleague in the same department as you (a department is defined as a group of   colleagues who report directly to the same Line Manager); 4.5.3  You  have  (or  formerly  had)  a  personal  relationship  with  another  AB  InBev colleague where one of the parties in the relationship has the ability to influence decision-making concerning the person's compensation, promotion, discipline or termination  (this  includes  AB  InBev  colleagues  in  different  departments,  but  at different Band levels); 4.5.4  You have (or formerly had) a personal relationship with anyone (including another AB  InBev  colleague,  AB  InBev  Business  Partner,  vendor,  supplier,  etc.)  that otherwise creates an actual or apparent conflict of interest. 4.6  The Ethics & Compliance Team will review reported conflicts of interest in light of all the  facts  and  will  determine  (a)  if  a  conflict  or  potential  conflict  exists;  and  (b)  if necessary,  an  appropriate  plan  of  action,  which  may  include  one  or  more  of  the following actions: 4.6.1  Transferring  supervisory,  decision-making,  evaluative,  and/or  other responsibilities; 4.6.2  Providing an additional layer of oversight to the supervisory role; 4.6.3  Transferring one of the individuals to another position; and/or 4.6.4  Taking any other action reasonably necessary to mitigate any potential adverse consequences. 4.7  In  making  the  disclosure,  colleagues  do  not need  to  specify  the  detailed  nature  of such personal relationships unless otherwise requested. 4.8  Failure to promptly notify the People Team or the Ethics & Compliance Team of the existence of a personal relationship under this Policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. "
"5.  PERSONAL INVESTMENTS,  FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN  AND  SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AB INBEV BUSINESS PARTNERS & COMPETITORS","Personal Investments, Financial Interests 5.1  A  financial  conflict  of  interest  can  arise  when  the  colleague's  judgment  could  be influenced,  or  might  appear  as  being  influenced,  by  the  possibility  of  personal financial gain. 5.2  The following scenarios create a potential conflict of interest: 5.2.1  AB  InBev  colleagues,  or  their  immediate  family  members,  having  a  financial interest in an AB InBev customer, supplier, service provider or other counterparty (hereinafter, 'Business Partners') or in an AB InBev competitor; 5.2.2  AB InBev colleagues receiving personal compensation from Business Partners; 5.2.3  AB InBev colleagues using confidential Company information for personal gain. 5.3  Any passive investment of not more than one percent (1%) of the total outstanding shares of a publicly traded company is permitted without AB InBev approval, provided that the investment is not so large financially (either in absolute dollars or percentage of  your  total  investment  portfolio)  that  it  creates  the  appearance  of  a  conflict  of interest. 5.4  However, AB InBev colleagues must disclose both to their Line Manager and to the Ethics  &  Compliance  Team  (through  the  Compliance  Channel  unless  otherwise directed  by  Compliance)  any  and  all  existing  financial  interests  or  planned investments,  including  investments  by  the  colleague's  immediate  family  members (which  includes  a  spouse,  parents  and  grandparents,  children  and  grandchildren,   brothers  and  sisters,  in-laws,  including  adopted,  half,  or  step  family  members),  in more than one percent (1%) of a public company or in a private company that is a current or potential competitor of AB InBev or that is an AB InBev Business Partner. In the case of new investments, AB InBev colleagues must first obtain approval from the  Ethics  &  Compliance  Team  in  advance  of  making  the  investment.  AB  InBev reserves  the  right  to  review  and  revisit  any  prior  investment  approvals  in  order  to avoid an actual or apparent conflict of interest. AB InBev may periodically conduct an inquiry of AB InBev colleagues to determine the status and circumstances of Board memberships  or  investments,  and  AB  InBev  colleagues  are  responsible  for continually monitoring and reporting any change in circumstances that might give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest. 5.5  For new investments, the Ethics & Compliance Team will review the situation in light of all the facts and will either prohibit the investment or permit the investment, which permission  may  include  implementing  one  or  more  of  the  following  conditions  or restrictions: 5.5.1  Clearly defined information barriers, restricting the colleagues from having access to  competitively  sensitive  information  that  could  be  used  to  the  benefit  of  the competitor or Business Partner (in their role at AB InBev) or AB InBev (through their interest in the competitor or Business Partner); 5.5.2  Restrictions on the colleague's ability to be involved in any decisions or meetings on behalf of the competitor or Business Partner with AB InBev or its competitors regarding competitively sensitive information; 5.5.3  Reminder to comply with AB InBev's confidentiality and employment obligations at all times; 5.5.4  Obligations  to  withdraw  from  discussions  or  decisions  at  AB  InBev  which  may affect the Business Partner and/or its competitors; 5.5.5  Ongoing  obligation  to notify  the  Ethics  &  Compliance Team  about any  material changes  to  the  colleague's  interests  or  involvement  with  the  competitor  or Business Partner; and/or 5.5.6  Restriction on using Company time or assets to assist the competitor or Business Partner. 5.6  For  existing  financial  interests,  the  Ethics  &  Compliance  Team  will  review  the situation in light of all the facts and will determine (a) if a conflict or potential conflict exists; and (b) if necessary, an appropriate management plan, which may include implementing one or more of the above-mentioned conditions or other appropriate conditions. Social Relationships with AB InBev Business Partners 5.7  AB  InBev  colleagues  should  not  have  social  or  other  relationships  with  AB  InBev Business Partners if the relationship would give the perception that an inappropriate business  influence  is  being  exerted.  Our  selection  of  Business  Partners  must  be based  on  objective  criteria  and  we  must  treat  our  Business  Partners  with  respect, fairness and honesty. We expect our Business Partners to follow all applicable legal requirements  in  their  business  practices,  as  well  as  the  standards  set  out  in  our Responsible  Sourcing  Policy.  If  you  believe  you  may  be  perceived  as  having  an inappropriately close relationship with a Business Partner, or appear to be exerting a business influence on the Business Partner, you must inform both your Line Manager and Ethics & Compliance Team through the Compliance Channel unless otherwise directed by the Ethics & Compliance Team.    "
6.  BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOUND THROUGH WORK,"6.1  Business  opportunities  discovered  through  your  work  here  belong  first  to  our Company, except as otherwise agreed to by AB InBev. 'Front-running,' defined as taking an investment opportunity based upon information gained from employment with  AB  InBev,  to  take  action  ahead  of  AB  InBev  for  personal  benefit,  will  always constitute  a  conflict  of  interest  and  must  be  reported  to  the  Ethics  &  Compliance Team. For example, a colleague may develop a relationship with a supplier to whom he/or  she  recently  awarded  a  contract  on  behalf  of  AB  InBev.  Through  that relationship,  the  colleague  may  become  aware  that  the  supplier  is  expanding  and buying  a  smaller  company.  Based  on  the  information  gathered  and  the  potential growth and opportunity, the colleague may want to purchase stock in the supplier. In this  situation,  the  colleague  may  not  take  (or  direct  to  a  third  party)  the  business opportunity  because  it  is  discovered  through  the  use  of  Company  property, information or position, unless the opportunity is approved by the Company. 6.2  Sometimes the line between personal and Company opportunities is difficult to draw and there may be both personal and Company opportunities in certain activities. You must  consult  the  Ethics  &  Compliance  Team  before  using  Company  property, information or your position at the Company in a manner not solely for the benefit of the Company. "
7.  INVENTIONS,"7.1  Developing  or  helping  to  develop  outside  inventions  that  a)  relate  to  AB  InBev's existing or reasonably anticipated products and services, b) relate to your position at AB  InBev,  or  c)  are  developed  using  AB  InBev  corporate  resources  may  create conflicts of interest. If you have any questions about potential conflicts or intellectual property  ownership  involving  an  outside  invention  or  other  intellectual  property, consult the Ethics & Compliance Team. "
8.  GIFTS & ENTERTAINMENT,"Receiving Gifts 8.1  Receiving gifts or entertainment from a current or future client or Business Partner can  potentially  create  a  conflict  of  interest,  especially  if  the  value  of  the  item  is significant. Do not accept any lavish gifts, meals or entertainment or anything of value that  could  inappropriately  bias  future  decision-making  or  create  an  appearance  of impropriety. 8.2  This is an area in which judgment is critical and it applies to all current or potential Business Partners, customers, counterparties, or service providers. For instance, a modest gift during the holiday season (such as Company-branded swag or simple gift baskets)  from  a  supplier  in  accordance  with  local  custom,  and  for  purposes  of enhancing the goodwill of a legitimate business relationship, is usually fine. Similarly, a  celebratory  meal  with  a  Business  Partner,  or  an  invitation  to  attend  a  cultural  or sporting event with the Business Partner, can also be fine - where not excessive. But an expensive weekend trip will likely not be permissible. 8.3  You should never receive cash, cash equivalents (such as gift cards), loans, or any item that obligates you to provide something in return, and you should not actively solicit  gifts  or  entertainment  from  a  current  or  potential  client  or  Business Partner. There is no globally applicable definition of what constitutes excessive, and what is customary and appropriate differs from country to country. In New York, for example, receiving in aggregate gifts and entertainment of a market value less than USD $200 from a vendor is unlikely to be considered excessive  - but that amount could  be  deemed  excessive  in  other  countries. Colleagues  should  check  with  the Ethics & Compliance Team when there is any doubt as to what can be accepted.    Giving Gifts 8.4  For our policy on gift giving, please refer to our Global Anti-Corruption Policy. If you plan  to  expense  any  gift  or  entertainment  to  be  provided  to  a  client  or  Business Partner, please review the Global ZBB Travel & Expense Policy. "
9.  OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT,"9.1  Outside  employment  by  AB  InBev  colleagues  with  an  AB  InBev  competitor  or Business Partner may create, or give the appearance of creating, a conflict of interest. AB InBev colleagues must not accept employment or other engagements that may create,  or  give  the  appearance  of  creating,  a  conflict  of  interest,  unless  such employment/engagement  has  been  approved  by  the  Company.  If  you  have  a question about whether outside employment is a potential conflict, contact your Line Manager,  the  People  Team,  or  the  Ethics  &  Compliance  Team  through  the Compliance Channel. "
"10. ADVISORY ROLES, BOARD SEATS, AND STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS","10.1 We  encourage  our  colleagues  to  be  active  in  industry  and  civic  associations. However, such activities can present a potential conflict of interest with AB InBev. AB InBev colleagues who serve on boards of directors or advisory boards of any entity or organization are required to disclose such obligations to the Ethics & Compliance Team through the Compliance Channel within 90 days of assuming such positions (or  within  90  days  of  the  implementation  date  of  this  Policy,  whichever  is later). Colleagues should consult with the People or Ethics & Compliance Team prior to assuming any such position when unsure whether their service could result in any potential adverse consequences to the Company. "
11. OUR STANDARDS,"11.1 This  Policy  sets  out  AB  InBev's  minimum  standards  for  addressing  conflicts  and potential conflicts of interest. Individual Zones, countries and/or business operations may  implement  additional  policies  addressing  conflicts  of  interest,  but  only  to  the extent those policies are consistent with this Policy. 11.2 Nothing in this Policy is meant to conflict with local law, including labor laws, which can vary from country to country. To the extent that you perceive an inconsistency between this Policy and with local law, please seek guidance from your local legal team as to how to resolve this inconsistency. 11.3 Colleagues represented by a labor organization retain all rights under their collective bargaining agreements and labor law including the right to use the grievance process. This  Policy  does  not  override  any  provisions  of  those  collective  bargaining agreements. 11.4 In the event of any dispute or ambiguity in the interpretation of this Policy, the same will  be  determined  by  AB  InBev,  whose  decision  shall  be  final  and  binding  on  the point. "
12. CONTACT US,"12.1 There are many ways to reach Compliance. 12.2 Questions  about  the  policies  or  disclosures  can  be  made  online  through  our Compliance Channel: http://compliancechannelglobal.ab-inbev.com. 12.3 We also are aware that colleagues may want to report concerns anonymously. We have a Compliance Helpline for that: access http://talkopenly.ab-inbev.com or call 1- 888-601-6762.  The  Compliance  Helpline  is  available  24  hours,  managed independently, and anonymous (at your option). The phone line is staffed with people that speak most of the languages that we have at AB InBev. 12.4 You  can  also  directly  contact  your  Line  Manager,  People  Business  Partner  or  the Ethics & Compliance Team.
